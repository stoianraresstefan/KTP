# Knowledge Technology Practical - Transport Logistics

As part of the Knowledge Systems Practical course, we have created a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) that aims to help an enterprise to choose a specific type of vehicle based on their shipment type, dimensions and weight, and also based on specific needs.

## Usage and UI

In order to run the program, open the console and run the following command:
